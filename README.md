## About

MINDTRAP is a **first-person puzzle platformer** where the main goal is to get through all the levels and wake up from a nightmare. The game uses **non-Euclidean geometry** and procedural content generation, such as **recursive backtracking algorithm** for labyrinth generation. Every gameplay is a **unique experience** in a way. There is an **auto save** implemented that is triggered after completion of each level. And also you can play with a mouse and keyboard as well as a **gamepad**.
